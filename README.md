# DepthQuantileFunctions
Mathematics Thesis (2022-23) Advised by Gabe Chandler (Pomona College)

Many machine learning and statistical methods rely on distance as a metric for similarity and dissimilarity. However, due to the curse of dimensionality and data sparsity in high dimensional ambient space, distance metrics are not always the best distinguishing measure. Depth Quantile Functions(DQF) map data points to real-valued single variable functions on the [0, 1] interval using ideas of statistical depth. DQFs have been shown to be effective and interpretable as part of algorithms for multiscale geometric feature extraction for high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data with applications in both supervised (classification) and unsupervised (anomaly detection) learning settings. The novelty of this thesis extending the uses of Depth Quantile Functions to clustering. The algorithm outlined and implemented is an user interactive clustering technique.

Depth Quantile Functions (DQFs) are innovated by Gabe Chandler (Pomona College Mathematics and Statistics) and Wolfgang Polonik (UC Davis Statistics). It was been shown to work well in [surpervised learning](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-49/issue-2/Multiscale-geometric-feature-extraction-for-high-dimensional-and-non-Euclidean/10.1214/20-AOS1988.full) and [anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06682). My work (advised by Gabe Chandler) extends the use of DQFs to unsupervised settings.
