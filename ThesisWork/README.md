# DepthQuantileFunctions
Mathematics Thesis (2022) Advised by Gabe Chandler (Pomona College)

Depth Quantile Functions (DQFs) are innovated by Gabe Chandler (Pomona College Mathematics and Statistics) and Wolfgang Polonik (UC Davis Statistics). It was been shown to work well in [surpervised learning](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-49/issue-2/Multiscale-geometric-feature-extraction-for-high-dimensional-and-non-Euclidean/10.1214/20-AOS1988.full) and [anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06682). My work (advised by Gabe Chandler) extends the use of DQFs to unsupervised settings.
